# Backstory
***
Hjalmar was born to Brok and Mariam Stone-Shaper, whom were originally from [campaign continent] before immigrating and giving birth to Hjalmar. Brok served as a part of the towns militia and upon retiring he worked as a smithy, the traditional trade of his family. Being skilled in combat and smithing, he trained Hjalmar in each discipline order to give him the basic skills to make something of himself. Mariam's family trade was masonry and rune carving, a skill gifted to her clan by the giants of the homeland long ago. She passed these two arts on to Hjalmar to uphold clan teachings. Historic clan elders speculate it originally was a promise to the giants, but such a promise has been long forgotten. Hjalmar studied with the clan elders regularly and vowed to determine the origins of the runic carving and forgotten history of his clan.

Having gained many skills and knowledge from his clan and family, Hjalmar set out for adventure when he reached the age of 57. He became a skilled archer and tracker, he felt attuned to nature and his surroundings. While adventuring he would still carve runes, which oddly made him feel at peace in the world of order and chaos. In his many bounties of dungeon diving and ruin running, Hjalmar developed a nimble stature that was uncanny among small-folk, he seemed faster and more dexterous than other of his kin.

During one bounty Hjalmar was running, he encountered a band of orcs and hobgoblins who quickly overran him and left him with severe injuries. Barely escaping with his life, Hjalmar lay hiding in thickets and dense forest drenched in sweat and blood. As his eyesight began to darken and hearing stifled to a muffle, he heard what he though was voices approaching, he began to pray to [Mical will provide the dwarven god]. Hjalmar awoke slowly, his body aching but no longer severely injured, he found himself surrounded by several humanoids. As he began to focus his sight, Hjalmar saw an elf, a dragonborn, and a human around him, all druids of the forest's grove. After realizing they saved his life, Hjalmar worked to repay the debt he owed them. Over the next year or two he learned a bit of magic and some languages from several of the grove's inhabitants. Having repaid his debt through service, Hjalmar departed from the grove with the knowledge gifted from an unexpected detour and friendship.

Returning to his home to visit the clan and his family, Hjalmar told his many stories of his adventures. He shared what knowledge he could with the clan elders, and studied again under them, he learned of the clan's original home, [campaign continent]. Remembering his vow before leaving many years ago, at the age of 75 Hjalmar set off to the homeland of his clan. He met an interesting group of adventures and decided to stick with them, telling them of his true goal, to find the forgotten history of his clan.
