# Recap

> While entering the natural port of Haranshire, known as the Shrieken Mire, the Grey Gull struck an uncharted reef and began to sink. As the crew scrambled, a group of lizardfolk attacked from the marsh. In the chaos, Citella and Morgan were knocked unconscious and captured, taken by Lizardfolk into the swamp.
> 
> They woke up in a crude holding pen, ankle-deep in dark still-water. Alongside them were three other prisoners: Tokhus, a seemingly blind lizardfolk, clearly long captured and capable, and Aegir and Freya, who appear to had both recently been taken as well. Together they remained in the holding pen, in a still silence.
> 
> Not long after, the prisoners were forced into a makeshift arena surrounded by chanting lizardfolk. A lizardfolk matriarch accused them of bringing corruption to the land and unleashed Imps and Dretches on the party. After a swift dispatchel, the Egg-Singer announced the coming of a real threat, an invisible hulking demon creature, a Balgura, who was released into the pit. Fortunately, for the party, the Balgura leaped out of the makeshift arena, turning on captors and causing havok.
> 
> In the chaos, the group escaped into the swamp through a weak section of palisade, smote down by Tokhus. The trek was harsh, but they made camp and survived the night, each employing their own tactic to survive the harsh environment. Come morrow, the party discussed a plan, and determined they must continue their trek to Thurmaster, the closest town to the Shrieken Mire. Along the way, they encountered a strange jackal-like creature blinking in and out of sight. Freya, being not of this world, recognized it as a blink dog, which oddly took an unusual liking to her.
> 
> Eventually, the group reached the small town of Thurmaster. After resting at the Hound and Tail inn, and after some light shenanigans, they met a wizard named Tauster, someone Citella and Morgan had heard of during their time on the Grey Gull. He was expecting a delivery frand upon prompting him about the package, offered the party 150 gold to retrieve it, despite his suspicions.
> 
> After securing a small boat from a local merchant, the group set out again, now level three and ready to return to Wreckage of the Grey Gull.
# Opening: Into the Mire
---
![[Birds.mp3#loop]]
![[River.mp3#loop]]

>As you set out down the Churnett River, you are greeted with a delightful morning. The river is flowing calmly, carrying the barge at a moderate unassisted pace, granting you all a moment to take in the atmosphere. It is a sunny day, thin wispy clouds decorate the blue sky and the chitter and chirping of wildlife can be heard all around you. The crisp morning air passes by you as a faint breeze as the barge carries you downstream.
>
>After a half-hour or so, the barge drifts towards a fork in the river. Straight ahead is an ever thickening splatter of oak and pine trees, forming the entrance tree line of what locals call the Blessed Wood. On your right, as you know, is the entrance of Shrieken Mire, a familiar and undesirable transition from rolling foothills to peat, reed, and cypress.
>
>Do you truly wish to reenter the Shrieken Mire?
>
>As you sail further down the Churnett into the boggy wetlands of the Shrieken Mire, the light seems to dim, not from clouds, but from the thickening haze rising off the water. The cypress trees twist and lean, draped in moss, as if they are leaning over to gaze at those who dare enter their domain. The cheerful birdsong fades, replaced by distant croaks, rustling reeds, and the occasional splash of something unseen.

![[Frogs.mp3#loop]]

>As your journey continues, the water grows darker and sluggish. Insects buzz thick in the air, and the scent of damp earth and slow decay settles over everything. The current slows as the river broadens and winds deeper into the mire, forcing you to guide the barge more carefully between tangled roots and half-sunken logs.
# Scene 1: A Giant Discovery
---
> Up ahead, along the muddy banks of the mire, something catches your eye, a group of humanoids, laying among the dense muck. As the barge drifts closer, the details come into view.
> 
> Four bodies lie scattered along the marsh edge, half-submerged in muck and reeds. Tools and woven baskets sit abandoned nearby—signs of foraging and fishing. The bodies are limp, twisted, and bruised.
> 
> The only sound now is the slow lap of water against the shore, and the low buzz of flies beginning to gather.

**Medicine Check DC 10**

> Each one bears the signs of blunt force: broken limbs, crushed ribs, skulls cracked like dry bark.
> No weapons drawn. No signs of struggle. Whatever found them, struck fast—and struck hard.

**Perception/Investigation/Survival Check DC 10**

> Surveying the area around the carnage closely, what at first appears to be a natural recession in the mud revealed itself to actually be several footprints, massive and humanoid, perhaps that of a large ogre or giant kin.

 No giants have been reported in Haranshire for as long as anyone can recall. For PCs of low level, slugging it out with giants should be effectively impossible, as one hit from a giant means instant death for all but the hardiest low-level character.

It should take the PCs some time to achieve a solution to this problem. The raiding giants are two Fomorians and their two young offspring. Every few days, the giants will be back, to take livestock and kill a few more people for sport, and survivors will be able to give a good description of the marauders. Killing them is beyond the ability of the PCs or the local militia. One possible solution is to dig pits large enough to trap a giant, cover them, and then try to lure the giants into falling into them. This may work, but the labor involved in digging the pits, the vast area open to the giants for raiding, and the difficulty involved in trapping all the giants at the same time makes this plan difficult at best to put into effect.

A second solution involves the dragon. [[Inzeldrin]].
# Scene 2: Ambush on the Barge
---

> The barge drifts slowly through a narrowing channel. Overhanging branches of cypress and mangrove begin to crowd the waterway, casting jagged shadows across the boat. It’s quieter now, too quiet. The sound of frogs has thinned, and even the insects seem muted.
> 
> Then, a sudden splash behind the stern. Another. To the port side, ripples. You aren’t alone.

**Combat Encounter: Lizardfolk Ambush**

Several lizardfolk burst from the mire, some clinging to the sides of the barge, others leaping from the water. They attempt to tip, bind, or disarm party members using nets and harpoons.

**Features of the Encounter:**
- The barge continues to drift slowly during combat (10 ft. per round downstream).
- Narrow gangplanks and crates onboard can be used for cover or to force acrobatics checks.
- If any lizardfolk are captured, they can be interrogated for information about sightings of giants, and fear of “something bigger moving south.”
# Scene 3: A Night on the Barge
---
> As the sun dips below the trees, the Shrieken Mire transforms once again. Mist curls along the water's surface. Every ripple, every creak of wood, sounds louder in the dark. Your barge floats almost silently through this black mirror, the world narrowed to a few feet of flickering lantern light.

Each party member takes watch. Roll a **d12** to determine what they observe.

### Night Watch Encounter Table (d12)
|d12|Encounter|
|---|---|
|1|Nothing unusual. The water is calm, and the night passes quietly under thick canopy.|
|2|A lone owl glides low over the barge, startling nearby frogs into silence.|
|3|Small bubbles rise steadily near the hull, but no source is visible beneath the surface.|
|4|A patch of fog rolls in unusually thick, obscuring vision for several minutes before thinning.|
|5|A school of fish jumps and scatters as if chased—nothing is seen pursuing them.|
|6|A soft thumping echoes from deeper in the mire. Distant drumming or something knocking wood. It fades after a few minutes.|
|7|A large bullfrog hops onto the barge, croaks once, then leaps back into the water. Odd, but harmless.|
|8|A faint glow, like foxfire or bioluminescent fungus, flickers in the trees nearby. Harmless and gone by morning.|
|9|A swarm of **Stirges** descends on the barge. 1d4+1 attack whoever is on watch. Their buzzing stirs the others awake.|
|10|Something brushes the underside of the boat. A deep, slow bump, then nothing. Investigation reveals no damage.|
|11|**Encounter**: A faint voice, gurgling and hard to place, speaks in Deep Speech from beneath the water. If listened to too long, the watcher makes a Wisdom save (DC 12) or suffers disturbing dreams and disadvantage on Perception checks until dawn.|
|12|**Encounter**: A solitary **Marsh Wight** crawls out of the water, confused and whispering for help. It attacks only if approached aggressively or stopped from reentering the water. Otherwise, it vanishes by dawn.|
> Come morning, a gray light filters through the canopy. The mist lifts just enough to reveal your surroundings, a twisted tableau of drowned trees and glimmering water. It’s quieter, but the swamp remains... watchful.
# Scene 4: Investigating the Wreckage
---
> Hours later, the Churnett River begins to widen and slow, its winding channel giving way to a broader stretch of water. You’ve reached the natural harbor of Haranshire, a crescent-shaped inlet flanked by uneven hills and marshy shoreline.
> 
> Off the southeastern bank, where a rocky shoal juts just beneath the waterline, lies the shattered remains of the Grey Gull. The wreck is tilted against the rocks, cracked open amidships, with the broken mast leaning across the tide like a skeletal finger. Waves lap at the ruined deck, and scattered crates drift nearby.

**The Task: Retrieve the Chest (Puzzle Encounter)**

The trunk (12" x 18" x 18", 20 lbs.) lies wedged inside the ship’s ruined hold, beneath a collapsed beam and half-flooded deck.

**Challenges:**
- The water is murky and waist-deep: Strength (Athletics) DC 14 to dive and locate the chest.
- The beam is stuck: DC 13 Strength or clever application of magic/tools.
- The wreck is unstable: Dex Save DC 12 to avoid injury from shifting wood or debris.
- Any arcane detection picks up magical runes inside the chest lid.

**Puzzle Variant:**
Encourage creative solutions like mage hand, flotation tricks, shaping water, or coordinated lifting. The chest is wizard-locked and trapped with explosive runes. If opened prematurely, it will detonate.

**Harpy Encounter (Triggers Upon Retrieval):**

> As the trunk is hoisted free from the hold, a shrill, echoing cry pierces the air. From the crags above, two harpies descend with ragged wings and sunken eyes, drawn to the lingering aura of magic.
> 
> They perch briefly, singing in haunting harmony, before diving toward the deck. Roll initiative.

# Scene 5: The Journey Back
---
> With your barge heavy and the river sluggish, progress is slow. The air thickens and the swamp seems to lean in once more. But it’s behind you now, mostly. Each push forward brings you closer to Thurmaster and away from the muck.

The journey upriver (35 miles at 8 miles/day) will take multiple days. Use this leg to seed more world-building, hint at dangers, or offer rewards.
## Midway Encounter: Strange Ruins

> On the second day, through a gap in the tree line, you spot something out of place, massive stone columns, mostly sunken, but unmistakably carved. Moss and vines cling to their surface, but the angles are too precise, the lines too foreign. Something ancient is here.

**If Investigated:**
- **Treasure**: Small cache or planar relic. Arcana or History DC 13 to identify Old Chaos origin.
- **Encounter**: Ambushed by abyssal creatures, such as shadowy dretches or chaos-tainted beasts.
## Midway Encounter: Inzeldrin’s Mound

> Far off to the west, barely visible through the trees, rises a great earthen mound, half-swallowed by the mire. It stands too symmetrical, too deliberate. Tokhus stiffens. “That’s hers,” he mutters. “The Queen of the Mire.”

If approached, refer to [[Inzeldrin]] for negotiation or interaction. No forced combat.
# Scene 6: Capture Them Alive!
---
> As the river narrows again, another barge drifts into view ahead, sturdier, flat-bottomed, and tied off to a nearby tree. A few rough-looking figures wave, calling out greetings and offering help mooring. They look... friendly enough. Maybe.

**Setup:** Bandits pretending to be travelers or local marshfolk. They try to tie off, then attack once aboard.

**Combat:**
- 2 archers (hidden near shore)
- 3 melee “farmhands” onboard
- Carlanis, a dangerous fighter targeting casters

**Tactics:**
- Attempt to knock out and capture spellcasters
- May use nets, poisons, or distractions
- If things go south for the party, allow Oleanne the druid to intervene subtly, leaving only clues

**Interrogation:**
If Carlanis is captured, he may reveal:
- They were hired to ambush “dangerous foreigners”
- Mentions of necromantic threats or dark magic in the region
# Scene 7: Returning to Thurmaster
---
> At last, the swamp begins to thin. The cypress trees grow farther apart, and the hills roll gently into view. The air feels less oppressive, the birdsong a little brighter.
> 
> By mid-afternoon, the familiar sight of Thurmaster comes into view, rooftops of thatch and stone, townsfolk moving about their day. The smoke from hearthfires rises peacefully against the sky.
> 
> After days in the mire, the scent of baking bread and fresh hay is almost disorienting.

Let the party relax, offload the chest, report to Tauster, and explore town. Use this moment to shift tone from survival back to small-town mystery and set up future arcs.
