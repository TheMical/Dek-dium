# Recap
- Read aloud. Relatively Concise ~250 words:
	- Citella and Morgan aboard the Grey Gull, struck a previously undiscovered jagged patch and found the ship sinking while entering the natural port of Haranshire, The Shrieken Mire. A group of lizardfolk from the mire ambushed the ship, kidnapping Citella and Morgan.
	- Citella and Morgan came to to being thrown into a cell (see # Opening: Awakening in the Pen)
	- Within the cell was Tokhus, Aegir, and Freya. Tokhus, seemingly the longest lasting of captives, and Aegir and Freya being recent acquisitions, found, seemingly lost, within the swamp by the Lizardfolk.
	- Rest of Session 1 - Blood in the Mire
		- The party fled from the lizardfolk camp as far as their legs could carry them, and rested in the mire. Each member took their best precaution to avoid the harsh elements. Tokhus of course, had no problem.
		- During their ruthless trek through the mire, the party stumbled upon a strange looking hound, jackal like in appearance, that seemingly vanishes in and out of reality at will. Freya recognized this as a Blink Dog, who seemed exceedingly receptive to her specifically.
	- The party returned to Thurmaster, met some of the locals and stayed the night in a tavern The Hound and Tail. In the morning, they met with Tauster, an old wizard who Citella and Morgan recognized the name of, he had been awaiting a package from the Grey Gull, a trunk of magical wares. While Tauster seemed suspicious the party offered to retrieve it for a total reward of 150gp.
	- The party convinced Barranas, the owner and proprietor of Barranas' Store to lend them a boat, for a small sum of gold, so they may make the trek down the river back to the grey gull.
	- The party also leveled up to 3.
# Opening: Sailing the Shrieken Mire
Read aloud setting the scene. Sailing slowly through the Mire.
# Scene 1: Ambush (Lizardfolk or Demons/Devils)
Combat encounter on the boat. Think it would be cool if the party is moving while they are being attacked. Both
# Scene 2: A Strange Discovery
See the [[The Shrieken Mire]] It has info on "An oddity of Shrieken Mire, the origins of which is known by none of its inhabitants is the emergence of strange ruins scattered all across the marshland. These ruins are fragments of a Bygone Kingdom that have traveled through the waters of The Old Chaos. The temple, that has barreled through time and space, was used to seal Ghylsharra, the spirit Naga exarch of Asmodeus. After being freed by the players actions, she has left the region in order to carry out her plans long in the making. In her wake, it appears fiends from the abyss are also slipping through cracks in the material plane and are a new threat in the region."
The effects of the old chaos' presence in the Shrieken mire could be a cool encounter. Maybe a ruin or some kind of strange thing that has fallen through the old chaos. The Old Chaos in my setting is close to Limbo in Forgotten Realms, it represents the void of space that has fragmented all of reality, and things sometimes fall through it, typically near deep water.
# Scene 3: A Night on the Barge
The section of the Churnet river the party is traveling is about 35 miles. They travel about 25/miles per day downstream, so they will spend a night on the barge. I imagine they will take watches. This is a great opportunity for atmosphere and maybe an encounter.
# Scene 4: Investigating the Wreckage
Read aloud describe the scene of exiting the south eastern mouth of the Churnett River and Encountering the wreckage of the Grey Gull. 
They are attempting to locate a 12" x 18" x 18" trunk (weighs some 20 lbs., including contents). I have two ideas for this encounter, maybe we do both. I think it would be good to make this some kind of "puzzle". Maybe it's too heavy/too deep to get the trunk or the wreckage is hard to navigate prompting the players to come up with a clever solution acquire the trunk It would be a good way to break up combat encounters across the session. Alternatively, I think this could be a good spot for a lizardfolk or harpy encounter.
# Scene 5: The Journey Back
The return to Thurmaster up the Churnett River by barge. They party is traveling 35 miles at 8 miles a day. Maybe this should be some kind of minigame to determine their encounters.
# Scene 6: Capture Them Alive!
This is going to be a slightly altered version of the intended Capture Them Alive! Encounter from A Night Below:

eginning the Campaign

Tile PCs are approached, wherever the campaign begins, by a middle-aged, dark-haired, slightly portly wizard who introduces himself as Gordrenn. "Pur¬ veyor of magical paraphernalia, material necessities, and related items to many wizards of note," he says rather pompously. Gordrenn has a problem. He has to deliver a chest of material components to the wizard Tauster, who lives in the village of Thurmaster in Haranshire. His usual couriers have just left his ser¬ vice for better pay elsewhere, and Gordrenn is des¬ perate to have the goods delivered. He's desperate enough to employ a bunch of mere Ist-level charac¬ ters to do the job. "Nothing terribly expensive or important, but Tauster gets very huffy if I'm even a day late," Gordrenn admits.

He offers the PCs 150 gp (as a group, not apiece) to take the chest (which is 12" x 18" x 18" and weighs some 20 lbs., including contents). If the PCs want to haggle, a successful Charisma check bargains Gor¬ drenn up to 180 gp plus 5 gp per PC for expenses along the way. "And don't even think about stealing it," Gordrenn warns them. "It's got a wizard's mark inside it, and I'll know wherever it is. Steal it and I'll send all kinds of bad things after you." Gordrenn will want a formal contract drawn up that lays out the terms, with all the PCs' signatures on it, witnessed at the nearest temple of a suitable lawful neutral deity. Once the PCs have set their marks to this, he hands a letter of credit to whichever of them has impressed him as the most responsible; this will only become negotiable when countersigned by Tauster in Thur¬ master.

The chest has a wizard lock cast at 3rd level, so the PCs should not be able to open it. If they do, they will probably regret it, as the inside lid has explosive runes inscribed upon it which inflict 6d4+6 points of damage to any reader. The chest itself contains 1,000 gp worth of odds and ends—a tiny bell and a spool of silver wire, a cone of horn, an engraved golden tube, several amber rods, sealed vials filled with mercury, bat guano, powdered iron, saltpetre, phos¬ phorus, and a quantity of sulfur, bits of rock crystal, and similar items. A successful Spellcraft profi¬ ciency check enables a PC to teil that these are mate¬ rial components for evocation spells of 1st through 4th level.

The PCs should approach Haranshire from the west, following the road which skirts the Lyrchwood, so that the route to Thurmaster passes through Milborne. They should travel on foot—they should not be able to afford horses at 1st level, and the river boats and barges heading upstream along the Churnett River should demand a passenger fee beyond their present means. The trip should last for several (mostly uneventful) days. If the DM wishes to have a random encounter or two along the way, he or she can draw one from the tables on the inside back cover of this booklet.

When the PCs are some hours away from Milborne, where the road runs close to the Lyrchwood, they have an encounter. The PCs see some farm laborers on the road ahead, heading toward them at a steady, weary pace. As they draw closer and seem ready to pass with a wary nod, two arrows, fol¬ lowed quickly by another two, fly out from the woods and fall among the PCs (DM's note: these are aimed at player-character warriors and thieves).

The "farmers" brandish clubs and staves, point to the woods, and yell "Bandits!" They hurry forward as if to dose ranks with the PCs for their mutual defense. However, as soon as they are within melee range, they attack the PCs. Two other warriors come rushing from the woods armed with swords, having shouldered their longbows. The heftiest of the "farmers," the fighter Carlanis, points at the PC who most looks like a speilcaster and yells to his men to "get that one!"

Capture Xfjetn Aline!

The sword-wielders will not attack priests or wiz¬ ards unless matters get desperate. These bandits are vicious and need make no morale check unless half of them have been killed or overcome (by a sleep spell, etc.). If they pass one morale check, they fight to the death. Each attacker has ld4 gp and 2d6 sp on his person.

If the PCs manage to capture a prisoner here, they learn little of value unless they have Carlanis himself. The other men were hired by Carlanis to ambush a group of people that he said were bringing danger¬ ous, necromantic magic into Haranshire (they put this more simply, of course, in terms of "bad magic" and "dead stuff"). As they see it, they were just defending the neighborhood against evil foreigners. Carlanis, however, has been paid by the priest Ranchefus (this villain appears in both Lured into Darkness" and "Evil in the Thomwood") to ambush the PCs and capture any priest or wizard among their number. He does not reveal this information, however, even under magical coercion, but claims that he was after the contents of the chest they carry.

This can be a tough encounter for a small party composed entirely of lst-level characters. If the PCs fare extremely badly due to poor dice roils, the adventure could end abruptly and prematurely right here. To avoid this disaster, allow the PCs to be battered into unconsciousness (should the dice fall that way). They awaken a day later, lying among the trees a short distance from the road.

Their wounds have been treated with herbs and spi¬ derweb and bound with leaves and vines; the worst of the injuries appear to have been magically healed. Their gear lies not far off, along with the mangled bodies of several of their would-be kid¬ nappers. The first PC to awaken may (Intelligence check) catch a glimpse of a wolf or a woman (equal chance of either) slinking away through the trees. Although they may not guess it for some time, this is Oleanne the druid, who rescued the party but prefers not to make her presence known.

After this first skirmish, the PCs should make their way peacefully to Milborne.
# Scene 7: Returning to Thurmaster
Small read aloud that pivots the tone from a harrowing swamp journey to pleasant and quaint on a nice afternoon.
