# Character Backstory
***
Morgan is a high elf swashbuckler rogue. He spent most of his life on a ship where he was the son of the captain, Hagthar. Ever since he was young he had a knack for learning scripts picks up speech quickly. He was forced to stay in his quarters to transcribe and translate for the crew. He would have to face punishments such as cleaning barnacles off the ship while it was still moving if he ever left. Occasionally at any port town that had a library he would be able to leave and explored every inch and read every book in those libraries. One of Morgan's quirks is listening to the ocean through his quarter's floor. He can listen to vibrations well which come in handy for lockpicking. One night during his listening slumber he was plagued with horrors of the deep. Unbeknownst to him he learned deep speech that will occasionally break his mediation cycle and send him into full blown panic attacks (that is the redacted language on my sheet).
