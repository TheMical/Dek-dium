# Character Backstory
***
Tokhus was born among the Marsh‑Born, a small lizardfolk clan that lived deep within Shrieken Mire off the coast of Haranshire. After a violent raid by mercenaries from Thurmaster, a nearby human settlement, some forty years ago, the clan kept its distance from humans and other outsiders. They lived within half‑submerged huts among cypress roots, hunted fish and marsh game, and kept to a simple life of predominantly survival. Pivotal to the clans culture was reverence for She-Who-Dreams, a green dragon who claims the Mire as her domain. Each night the clan’s egg‑singers recited the laws of reverence while an offering of food was carried to her mound.

After Tokhus uncovered the flooded chamber buried within the Mire, a strange ruin constructed of a pale stone unlike anything he had seen, and spent a year chipping its stone door with a pickaxe, he made his way inside the strange chamber. Inside, the air was still and a large entity filled the room. Slowly, a colossal serpent unfurled, possessing white scales edged with gold and large green eyes. Surging out in a blur it struck him full in the face, the venom scalding his sight to darkness.

Tokhus staggered sightless through the swamp for days, surviving on instinct until hunters of his own clan found him. Expecting guidance home and healing, instead Tokhus was met with rope and net.

For reasons Tokhus still does not understand, he was bound and forced to fight in a crude arena against strange fiends captured near the new ruins. While other prisoners died or were taken away, he simply continued to survive.

And thus our story begins with Tokhus in the now familiar standby cage as he hears people approaching...
