# Session 1 - Blood in the Mire
Date: 03/13/2025
## Opening: Awakening in the Pen

> “Darkness. Damp air. The smell of wet wood and dank earth and something fouler, sulphor perhaps. A ring of rough-hewn wooden palisades surrounds you, slick with mud and vine. Ankle deep water surrounds you, making it hard to rest. Silence hangs heavy—until…
> 
> “A heavy panel in the palisade slides open. Four lean lizardfolk warriors, their jade-green scales mottled with mud and bone-tipped spears clutched in clawed hands, shove in two more captives, bleeding and bound, are thrust inside. "Darthir skaal!" The panel snaps shut behind them.”

*Darthir skaal!”* - Draconic for "Foolish Intruders"

- The Holding Pen:
    - Circular enclosure of crude cypress timbers, sharpened tops lashed with vine
    - Floor of packed earth, stained dark and slick with mud
    - Ankle deep marsh water.

- Player Introductions:
    - Each player takes 1–2 minutes to share their thoughts and last memories
    - The former-tribesmember PC may notice a small bone medallion tied to the nearest palisade post—a symbol of the Marsh-Born
## Scene 1: The Match Begins

> “Beyond the palisade, the gentle slap of tails brushes shallow water. A low, rhythmic chant of dozens of guttural voices swells and ebbs, punctuated by the creak of raised wooden platforms and soft thuds as claws shift on timber. A distant splash hints at something large being driven toward the arena.
> 
> A thick rope creaks as it winds around a notched timber capstan. Four lizardfolk strain against it, hauling aloft a section of the palisade. Splinters fly as the panel slides up, revealing a circular arena floor slick with mud and shallow water, and an open ceiling where driftwood spikes lean inward from above.
> 
> A tall, lizardfolk woman rises onto a raised platform wielding a staff made of gnarled root bone, a necklace of gemstones and feathers, and intense slit-pupiled eyes. She begins: ‘Marshborn! Hear me! These interlopers bring naught but spoil and war. Once again strangers have poisoned our waters and sullied our land with corruption. Now, they shall be claimed by the fate they have wrought!'
>
>As her words echo, the opposite panel creaks open once more. Two hunched, horned humanoids—skin cracked like old leather, eyes glowing ember-red—and four squat, brutish figures bristling with coarse fur and jagged teeth spill into the pit, claws scraping the earth and malice burning in their gaze.”
>
>**Everybody, Roll Initiative**

## Scene 4: Imp & Dretch Ambush

Arena & Hazards:

- Gate Opens: A ramp slides down from the palisade wall; two imps and four dretches enter
    
- Arena Construction: Enclosed by high wooden palisades of swamp logs bound with vines and rope; floor is packed earth streaked with mud
    

Hazards:

1. Rusted chains hang along the walls (Dex DC 12 save or 1d6 bludgeoning)
    
2. Slippery algae covers patches of floor (Acrobatics DC 10 to avoid difficult terrain)
    
3. Shallow acid pool in one corner (1d4 acid damage per turn spent in it)
    

Enemy Tactics:

- Imps: One casts _Invisibility_; the other hurls _Fire Bolt_ from cover
    
- Dretches: Charge forward to grapple, retreat toward the acid if injured
    
- Guard Snipers: Two lizardfolk on raised wooden platforms lob electrified javelins (1d6 lightning, Con DC 13 half)
    

## Scene 5: Matriarch’s Triumph & Balgura Emerges

Read Aloud:

> “Fools fall easily. But now… the true fury rises!”

- Second Gate: A heavy wooden portcullis bound with rare iron bands creaks upward
    
- Silence: Heavy breathing echoes—nothing is visible
    

Read Aloud:

> “With a thunderous roar, a hulking fiend erupts from the depths. Nearly ten feet tall, its matted black fur slick with swamp water, it stands on knuckles like a monstrous ape. Horns jut from its skull, eyes burning crimson, talons curved like bone knives.”

Balgura Notes (for DM):

- Ape-like posture; no wings
    
- Thick hide resists nonmagical slashing (DR 5)
    
- Uses powerful grapple and claw attacks
    

## Scene 6: The Great Escape

Chaos: The balgura rampages, flinging lizardfolk into the stands; panicked guards scatter

Escape Routes:

- Side Gate Slit: A narrow exit behind a reed curtain (Perception DC 13 to spot)
    
- Crowd Break: Dash through panicked lizardfolk (Dex DC 12; risk 1d8 spear damage or grapple escape DC 13)
    
- Underwater Sluice: Submerge through a flooded channel beneath the floor (Athletics DC 14)
    
- Climb the Palisade: Scale the inside of the wooden wall (Strength DC 15; fall causes 1d4 bludgeoning)
    

Consequences: Failing a check may result in damage or delayed escape

## Scene 7: Trek Through the Shrieken Mire

Lizardfolk Construction:

- Huts & Platforms: Half-submerged on cypress-root stilts; thatched reed roofs sealed with resin
    
- Metal Use: Virtually none; tools and weapons made of obsidian, bone, and driftwood
    

Skill Challenge (4 successes before 2 failures):

1. Survival (DC 13): Navigate quaking peat
    
2. Perception (DC 12): Spot a lurking swamp drake
    
3. Stealth (DC 11): Avoid a scouting party on stilts
    
4. Athletics (DC 14): Climb over fallen, slick logs
    

Failures: 1d4 bludgeoning (twisted ankle), 1d4 acid (hidden pool), or alert more pursuers

## Scene 8: Rest & Strategic Decisions

Camp Options:

- Deep Mire Clearing: Hidden but dangerous; PC with Marsh-Born ties might coax a fire from dried reeds
    
- Mire’s Edge (Grey Gull Wreck): Near the ship’s hull and sealed iron-bound trunk bearing Thurmaster’s crest
    

Morgan (NPC):

> “That trunk—heavy, iron-reinforced—bears Thurmaster’s seal. There may be letters inside for the city guard… or something more…”

Player Questions:

- “Where will you camp—and why?”
    
- “Do you circle back to the Grey Gull, head to Milborne, or risk Thurmaster itself?”
    
- “How will you handle your lizardfolk ally’s divided loyalties?”
