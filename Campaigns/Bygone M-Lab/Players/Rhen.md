In the murky depths of Mistwater Hollow, Rhen, a rugged half-Orc, stumbled upon Aegir, a human ensnared by the marsh's treacherous grip. Rhen discovered Aegir passed out, half-drowned, and covered with mud within the marsh. Rhen rescued Aegir, resuscitating him and traveling together deeper into the Bygone Valley. During their travels, they met Briary, an oddly adorned Firbolg who agreed to guide them to civilization. Together, they followed the Bygone Road to the town of Tarsalstead, a small human village amidst the rolling plains of the Bygone Valley.
