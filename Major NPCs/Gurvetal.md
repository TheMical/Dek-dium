# Physical Characteristics
Gurvetal stands in stark contrast to his sibling, embodying tranquility and grace. His sleek, serpentine body is adorned with scales of muted silver and pale blue, giving him a subtle, ethereal presence. His wings, when unfurled, reveal feathers that shimmer with an iridescent glow, evoking the celestial light of Jazirian. His eyes, the color of the deep ocean, radiate calm and wisdom.

# Backstory
As an exarch of Jazirian, Gurvetal was born from the same divine blood as his sister Ghylsshara, destined to maintain the balance that their parents once represented. Throughout history, Gurvetal has served as a protector and guide, appearing in times of great need to aid those who seek harmony and justice. When Ghylsshara began her plot to corrupt Du'um, Gurvetal followed, knowing that he could not allow her influence to go unchecked. Aligning himself with Auna and her cause, he became a silent guardian of the kingdom. In the climactic battle, unable to destroy his sister, Gurvetal chose to imprison himself within a sword alongside her, ensuring that balance would be maintained, even in death.

# Goals
Gurvetal’s goal is to preserve the balance of the world, particularly the moral and metaphysical equilibrium that his sister seeks to destroy. He knows that his existence is tied to hers, and he seeks to prevent her escape at all costs. Should Ghylsshara be freed, he would sacrifice himself once again to stop her.

# Motives
Unlike Ghylsshara, Gurvetal does not seek power for himself. His primary motivation is the protection of the natural order and the prevention of tyranny and corruption. He is a reluctant warrior, always striving for peace and only resorting to violence when necessary. His imprisonment within the Fang of Gurvetal reflects his willingness to sacrifice his freedom to ensure that his sister’s malevolent influence is contained.
