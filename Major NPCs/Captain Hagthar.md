| ------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Race / Age**     | Human, mid‑50s                                                                                 |
| **Role**           | Grey‑market privateer & merchant captain of the brigantine *Sea Sable*                         |
| **Alignment**      | Neutral (leans Lawful)                                                                         |
| **Family**         | Morgan (half‑elf son, ship’s translator)                                                       |
| **Current Status** | Ship damaged on hidden shoals at Haranshire; off‑loading cargo while overseeing hasty repairs  |
| **Adventure Hook** | Holds a sealed deed for the **Deepford Silver Mine** to be countersigned by **Count Parlfray** |

## Appearance
Weather‑creased face framed by iron‑grey hair and a neatly braided beard. Wears a battered tricorn, long navy coat stitched with silver thread, and carries a slim ivory‑handled boarding sabre. Walks with a slight limp (old grappling‑hook injury).

## Personality
* **Core Traits **: Commanding, pragmatic, fiercely loyal to crew.  
* **Mannerisms **: Taps the pommel of his sabre while thinking; whistles sea‑shanties when pleased.  
* **Flaws **: Sees contracts as suggestions; harbors guilt for keeping Morgan confined.  
* **Ideals **: “A ship is only as strong as her word—and her cannons.”  

## Background
1. Born the third son of a minor coastal baron; disowned after joining a smuggler flotilla during a local tariff war.  
2. Climbed ranks through daring ‘cut‑rate deliveries’ between rival ports, earning the sobriquet **“Hagthar the Grey Gull.”**  
3. Fathered Morgan during a diplomatic dalliance with an elven envoy; the mother perished in childbirth aboard ship.  
4. Blends legitimate charters (grain, timber, letters‑of‑marque) with shadow cargo (arcane curios, fugitive passengers).  
5. Recently accepted a commission from Count Parlfray’s agent to ferry legal documents and funds for the Deepford Silver Mine purchase.

## Goals & Motivations
- **Primary**: Repair the *Sea Sable* and deliver mine paperwork on schedule—salvage fee rests on punctuality.  
- **Secondary**: Recover Morgan (captured by Shrieken Mire lizardfolk) without exposing the ship’s contraband manifest.  
- **Long‑Term**: Secure a permanent smuggler’s haven in Haranshire to sidestep increasing tariffs on the Inner Sea.

## Relationships
| NPC | Nature of Relationship | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **Morgan** | Estranged yet protective son | Struggles to balance fatherly pride with regret. |
| **Catille Mollen** | “Paying passenger” (secret investigator) | Suspects her cover; keeps her within arm’s reach. |
| **Count Parlfray** | Contractual ally | Counts on Hagthar’s discretion; unaware of his smuggling. |
| **First Mate Salis Rook** | Trusted confidant | Oversees crew discipline; covers for Hagthar’s schemes. |
| **Shrieken Mire Lizardfolk** | Hostile raiders | Believe Hagthar trespassed sacred tidal stones. |

## Secrets & Plot Hooks
- Hagthar’s hidden logbook lists **coded deliveries of indentured workers**—proof of skirting the slave trade.  
- The *Sea Sable*’s ballast hides **six crates of illicit illithid crystal** bound for an Underdark buyer.  
- Hagthar carries an **unpaid blood‑debt rune** that throbs when within a mile of a certain dwarven bounty hunter.  
- A **chart of vanished islands** (actually migrating dragon‑turtle shells) explains the “rocks” that crippled his ship.

## Tactics & Abilities
- **CR 6 Veteran‑Captain** (use Bandit Captain stat block plus *Parry* reaction).  
- **Legendary Actions (1/round)**: *Command Ally* (grant ally attack), *Evasive Footwork* (+2 AC until next turn).  
- Prefers **smoke bombs & grappling hooks** over direct cannon fire when protecting cargo secrecy.

## Loot & Resources
* **Captain’s Sabre** (rapier, counts as +1 vs. creatures of the sea).  
* **Sealed adamant coffer** (contains 5,000 gp in letters of credit).  
* **False‑bottom strongbox** (logbook, cipher wheel, illithid crystal samples).  
* **The *Sea Sable***: brigantine with hidden swivel‑gun and experimental collapsible mast.

### Using Hagthar in Play
- Hagthar can be patron **or** antagonist depending on whether the PCs expose his darker dealings.  
- A rescue of Morgan buys goodwill; blackmail over the slave‑trade cipher forces tough choices.  
- If confronted, Hagthar offers 15 % stake in Deepford Mine for silence—or a broadside for betrayal.
