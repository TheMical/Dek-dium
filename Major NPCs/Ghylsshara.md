# Physical Characteristics
Ghylsshara is a majestic yet terrifying figure. She possesses the elongated, serpentine body of a naga, covered in shimmering gold and white scales that seem to glow with a deceptive warmth. Her eyes are a piercing, venomous green, and her fanged maw often forms a predatory smile. At her full length, she stretches over 20 feet, and her body coils with hypnotic grace, emphasizing her manipulative nature.

# Backstory
Born from the chaotic separation of Jazirian and Ahriman, Ghylsshara is the embodiment of ambition and deception. She was an exarch of Ahriman, carrying out his will across the material plane. However, with Ahriman's fall and his transformation into Asmodeus, her goals shifted. She sought to dominate her twin brother Gurvetal, desiring to subjugate the balance he represented. Du'um became her chosen battlefield, where she manipulated the mortal rulers to fulfill her plans. Ghylsshara saw Silver as a means to an end, feeding his lust for power with whispers of necromancy and dark magic. After her defeat and entrapment within the Fang of Ghylsshara, she bides her time, waiting for the right mortal to release her and continue her plot.

# Goals
Ghylsshara’s ultimate goal is to disrupt the balance of the world and establish a realm where tyranny, indulgence, and suffering reign supreme. She wishes to escape her imprisonment within the sword and reclaim her physical form, but more importantly, she seeks to defeat and consume her brother Gurvetal, completing her long-held vision of power.

# Motives
Ghylsshara is driven by a deep hatred for balance and order. Her sibling’s existence is a constant reminder of what she considers weakness—restraint and compassion. She views mortals as tools to be corrupted and used, and her whispers often offer promises of power, masking her true intent to turn them into pawns for her grand design of eternal chaos.
