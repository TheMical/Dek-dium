# Mistwater Hollow
***
Mistwater Hollow is a mysterious valley surrounded by dense forests, marshes and hills. The lake at its center, shrouded in perpetual mist, is a tranquil yet eerie expanse of water. The mist, a result of the ceaseless spinning whirlpool caused by the presence of Xul'karesh, gives the lake an otherworldly and ethereal feel. The murky water is deep and dark, obscuring what lies beneath.

# Ssth'kari Tribe
***
The Ssth'kari are a reclusive Lizardfolk tribe that has made Mistwater Hollow their home for generations. Their scales blend with the murky environment, making them adept hunters and stealthy navigators in the mist. The tribe has a complex societal structure, with shamans serving as intermediaries between the tribe and Xul'karesh. They are known for their intricate rituals and ceremonies conducted on their floating rafts and platforms.

# Deity Xul'karesh
***
Xul'karesh is an ancient and enigmatic aquatic entity, often depicted as a serpent-like being with scales that shimmer like the depths of the lake. The deity is said to reside within the whirlpool at the heart of Mistwater Hollow, where it holds dominion over the secrets of the deep. The Ssth'kari believe that Xul'karesh guides their fate, providing them with bountiful catches and protection in exchange for offerings and reverence.

# Aegir's Pact with Xul'karesh
***
When your player nearly drowned in the shipwreck, they unknowingly made a desperate pact with Xul'karesh to survive. However, the entity, ever mysterious, chose to place them ashore in Mistwater Hollow instead of their intended destination. The pact granted the player powers over the sea, but the landlocked nature of Mistwater Hollow has made these abilities less effective, leaving the player in a situation akin to a monkey's paw. Xul'karesh's motives for this choice remain a mystery, and the player may find themselves entangled in the web of secrets surrounding Mistwater Hollow.
