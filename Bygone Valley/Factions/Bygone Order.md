# Description
***
Deep within the heart of the Bygone Valley, nestled amidst the ruins of the ancient kingdom that once flourished there, lies the secretive enclave of the Bygone Order. This enigmatic group of individuals is dedicated to the singular goal of resurrecting the long-lost glory of the ancient kingdom, embracing the traditions, customs, and language of a bygone era with fervent zeal. However, their obsession with the past has led them to be regarded as eccentric at best and dangerously unhinged at worst by outsiders.

# Location
***
The Bygone Order makes its home within the crumbling ruins of the former capital city of the Bygone Kingdom, situated on the eastern side of the valley. The once-grand structures now lie in various states of decay, their majestic spires and towering walls reduced to rubble and overgrown with creeping vines and moss. Despite the passage of centuries, a palpable aura of faded grandeur still hangs over the ruins, evoking memories of a time long past.

# Beliefs and Practices
***
The members of the Bygone Order adhere fanatically to the belief that they are the rightful heirs to the ancient kingdom, tasked with the sacred duty of restoring its former glory. They speak in antiquated language, dressing in clothing reminiscent of the kingdom's heyday and following customs and rituals long forgotten by the outside world. Their devotion to the past borders on obsession, with some even going so far as to renounce their own identities in favor of assuming the roles of long-dead monarchs, nobles, and knights.

# Hostility Towards Outsiders
***
Outwardly hostile to outsiders, the members of the Bygone Order view any intrusion into their domain as a trespass upon the sacred land of their ancestors. Travelers who stumble upon their enclave are met with suspicion and disdain, often facing verbal tirades or even physical aggression if they refuse to heed the Order's warnings to leave. Despite their isolationist stance, rumors persist of clandestine dealings and covert operations conducted by the Order, hinting at darker motives lurking beneath their fa√ßade of antiquated nobility.
