# Description
***
Nestled deep within the ancient and secluded forest Gahlalor is Alaeluna, a magical Elven settlement inhabited by High Elves. Alaeluna is made up of around ten beautifully crafted elven buildings and a dozen smaller homes. The buildings are designed with magically hewn stone and wood forming organic and architectural marvels. Magic is not merely a tool in Alaeluna; it is an integral part of daily life, enhancing both the functionality and beauty of the city. A striking example of this is the magical lights crafted with elven magic that illuminate Alaeluna come nightfall.

# Geography
***
Situated within Gahlalor, or the Moonlight Forest as the humans would call it, Alaeluna's surroundings are a pristine blend of towering ancient trees and crystalline streams. The settlement itself is deep within the woods amidst the verdant foliage. The elves know Gahlalor to be enchanted,  revealing the true nature of its mundane exterior, when under the moon's light. In this magical moonlight, Shapechangers revert to their original form, the waters rejuvenate those who bathe in them, and connection to the magical essence of the world is strengthened.

# Government
***
Alaeluna operates under a council of elven elders, each chosen for their wisdom, magical prowess, and commitment to preserving the elven way of life. The council oversees the day-to-day affairs of the settlement and deliberates on matters of great importance, particularly in times of crisis. The recent attack by the Warband has left the council in a state of urgency, prompting intense debates about the future of Alaeluna and how to best defend against external threats.

# History:
***
Ages ago, the ancient High Elves discovered the magical properties of Gahlalor and built a sanctuary, to the moon and its magics, within it. This sanctuary served as the first building of Alaeluna, creating a haven that became the heart of the settlement. The sanctuary was a source of humanitarian aid, where the elves shared the forest's healing properties with anyone they encountered. Countless Years later, the settlement of Alaeluna exists surrounding this sanctuary.

# Inhabitants:
***
Life in Alaeluna revolves around the coexisting with nature and magic. The inhabitants of Alaeluna live in close communion with the enchanted forest and the moon. The society places a strong emphasis on the arcane arts, and members are trained in magic from a young age. Professions within Alaeluna are deeply intertwined with magic, with craftsmen, healers, and scholars all incorporating magic into their daily pursuits.
  
Per ancient tradition, Alaeluna is heavily sectioned by age and gender. Young Elven women are raised as healers, scholars, and artists. Young Elven men, on the other hand, are raised as warriors, scholars, and craftsmen. The eldest elves in Alaeluna serve as the de facto guides and decision makers of the society.  

A unique aspect of Alaeluna's society is the presence of Bladesingers – a sect of warrior scholars who master the art of Bladesinging. These warriors serve as the primary military force, protecting the settlement with a dance of blades infused with arcane power.

## Anarion's Mission:

Following your recent session with the council, the words of High Elder Elucindera rings through your mind:  
  
"To begin, the council and I would like to open with a formal expression of our sympathy and condolences to you, Anarion. What happened to your brother and many others on the day of the attack was unequivocally a tragedy. The council has spent several days and countless sessions deciding on an appropriate course of action in response. Anarion, the council wants to make it clear, The Warband is a menace that threatens the lives of countless innocent people across Dekádium and we, along with the denizens of Alaeluna, plan to exercise everything within our power to prevent future tragedies of this nature.  
  
Now, onto the topic of today's session. Young Sword-dancer Anarion, following your conversation with Chancellor Cerius, the council understands your desire to take charge in response to the lingering Warband threat. After deliberation, the council has decided that remaining still and letting the defenseless come to us would not be sufficient. We recognize the urgency of the situation and the need to take a proactive stance against the Warband's encroachment.

Therefore, the council has determined that a new chapter in the defense of our lands must unfold. Anarion, you and your fellow Bladesingers are entrusted with a vital mission – to be messengers, protectors, and beacons of hope to the local settlements that surround us. As you venture forth into the region, your task is two-fold: to investigate the status of these settlements, assessing the impact of the Warband threat, and to provide aid wherever possible. The compassion and strength of the Bladesong shall not be confined to Alaeluna alone, but shall radiate outward, a shield against the encroaching darkness.

Anarion, your journey carries not only the weight of Alaeluna but the collective hope of all who reside in these lands. May the moonlight guide your blades, and may your endeavors bring solace to those in need. The council stands united in support of this mission, trusting in your resilience and benevolence as you embark on your quest. As you leave the embrace of Alaeluna, without your kin to guide you, the council requests one last thing: never forget your creed."  
 

Creed of the Luminarian Bladesingers

In the dance of blades and the symphony of magic, we, the Bladesingers of Luminara Sanctum, find purpose beyond our martial prowess. Enveloped by the moonlit embrace of Gahlalor, we solemnly swear to be the guardians of Alaeluna and providers of solace and aid to those in need. Our blades are not only instruments of defense but tools of healing and compassion. Under the moonlight's grace we sing our solemn promise: to safeguard the defenseless, spread compassion, and protect others with the grace and strength that defines our Bladesong.
