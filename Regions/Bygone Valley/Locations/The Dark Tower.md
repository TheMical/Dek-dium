# Description
***
Rising ominously from the desolate basin at the North-Eastern tip of the Bygone Valley, the Tower of Kalarel the Vile casts a foreboding shadow over the surrounding landscape. Constructed from blackstone of an unknown origin, the tower looms like a sinister sentinel, its dark spires piercing the sky with an air of malevolent intent. While its exact origins remain shrouded in mystery, whispers abound of its connection to ancient powers and dark magics, weaving tales of horror and despair around its forbidding facade.

# Location
***
Perched upon a windswept plateau at the edge of the basin, the Tower commands a commanding view of the surrounding terrain, its brooding presence dominating the horizon for miles around. Surrounded by a desolate landscape of barren earth and twisted vegetation, the Tower stands as a stark reminder of the encroaching darkness that lurks within the heart of the Bygone Valley.

# History
***
Legend tells of a time when the Tower did not exist, when the basin lay empty and untouched by mortal hands. However, the truth of its origins remains obscured by the mists of time, lost to the annals of history and forgotten by all but the most learned scholars. Some whisper that the Tower is the remnant of a bygone age, a relic of a long-lost civilization that once thrived in the valley before succumbing to ruin and decay. Others claim that it is a newer construction, erected by dark forces seeking to harness the power of the valley's ancient ley lines for their own nefarious purposes.

# The Necromancer's Lair
***
Within the shadowed halls of the Tower, Kalarel the Vile, Scion of Orcus, reigns supreme as the master of death and decay. A necromancer of unparalleled skill and ambition, Kalarel seeks to unravel the secrets of immortality and transcendence, delving ever deeper into the forbidden arts of necromancy and dark sorcery. From his unholy sanctum deep within the Tower's bowels, he commands legions of undead minions and eldritch abominations, his dark influence spreading like a cancer throughout the land.

# The Abyssal Pact
***
Whispers speak of a foul pact forged between Kalarel and the dread demon lord Orcus, granting the necromancer unholy powers beyond mortal comprehension in exchange for his servitude and devotion. It is said that Kalarel's every action serves to further the will of his malevolent master, spreading death and despair in his wake as he seeks to unleash the forces of darkness upon the world.

# What Yama Knows
***
You were in your isolated abode, surrounded by the musty scent of old tomes and the faint flicker of candlelight casting dancing shadows on the walls. The air was heavy with the weight of your thoughts as you poured over ancient texts, seeking answers in the forgotten knowledge of ages past.

Suddenly, a desperate cry shattered the silence, echoing through the stillness of your sanctuary. Rushing to the door, you found a disheveled man stumbling towards your doorstep, his eyes wide with fear and exhaustion. He pleaded for help, his words tumbling out in a jumble of urgency and confusion.

"Please, you have to help me," he gasped, his voice ragged with panic. "It's... it's the gold... the red gold..."

Confusion clouded your mind as you tried to make sense of his frantic words. "What about the red gold?" you pressed, concern knotting your brow.

The man struggled to compose himself, his breaths coming in ragged gasps as he recounted his harrowing tale. "I... I was working in the mines, in the Bygone Valley," he began, his voice trembling with the weight of his memories. "They paid us with gold, but... it was red, deep red, like blood..."

His words sent a shiver down your spine, a chill creeping into your bones as you listened intently. "Go on," you urged, your voice barely a whisper.

"A man... he died," the disheveled man continued, his eyes haunted by the memory. "Trapped in a cave-in... and then... then they came. Hooded men, moving like shadows in the darkness, and a figure... levitating above the ground, dressed in red and black..."

"What did they want?" you asked, your voice barely above a whisper.

"The body," the man replied, his voice trembling with fear. "They wanted the body... and they paid me with more of that cursed gold..."

A chill wind swept through the room, carrying with it the echoes of dark whispers and forbidden secrets. "And now?" you pressed, your heart heavy with foreboding.

"They come... whenever death comes," the man confessed, his voice a desperate plea for salvation. "I can't escape them... I heard... I heard there's a necromancer nearby... maybe he can help... maybe he can rid me of this cursed gold..."  
  
You'd heard word of strange necromancy in the region far before your encounter with the disheveled man. Years ago, word spread of a strange Dark Tower looming over the Bygone Valley. You are unsure why you followed this lead, but clearly some powerful necromancy is at play, maybe it's your only chance.

This was the event that lead you to the Bygone Valley, setting on the long road until today, arriving in the quaint town of Tarsalstead, the red gold still jingling in your bag.
