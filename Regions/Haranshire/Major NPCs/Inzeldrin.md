# Overview
---
Inzeldrin is an Old Green Dragon who dwells in the southern reaches of the Shrieken Mire. She considers herself the Queen of the Mire, and although evil, she is mostly disinterested in direct conflict or territorial expansion. She prefers to doze, daydream, and reflect on deeper mysteries. Livestock is taken only on rare occasions and always while invisible—she finds raiding beneath her.

Inzeldrin is appeased by the lizardfolk of the Mire, who offer her reverence and the occasional tribute. She does not meddle with the people of Haranshire unless directly provoked or given reason. She values flattery and polite respect, expecting all who approach to understand her dominance without being told.

While she will not initiate hostility with adventurers, she is highly perceptive—able to detect hidden or invisible intruders. If attacked, she will not hesitate to kill, though she may spare some of the party as a warning. Wise adventurers should play to her pride and territorial nature.

# Potential Role in Fomorian Conflict
---
Inzeldrin may be enlisted to deal with the threat of the marauding fomorian giants. The giants have no treasure worth her time, but the promise of livestock offered at regular intervals and a respectful agreement from the locals could convince her to intervene. She may also be persuaded if her authority over the Mire is threatened or insulted by the giants’ actions.

# Personality and Motivation
---
She is introspective and desires solitude more than treasure. Though lawful, she demands a proper exchange for her help. Mere promises or tales will not impress her. If offered a deal that benefits her lazily maintained dominion, she will honor it fully.

# Knowledge of the Wider World
---
Inzeldrin possesses fragmentary but useful knowledge about nearby mysteries. She may be aware of:
- A nest of orcs beneath the Garlstone Mine
- Routes to the Underdark
- Fandruzsch, the shadow dragon
- Priests of Myrkul-Cyric/Nerull/Thanatos (though none reside in the Mire)
- The location and significance of the old keep in the Thornwood

She does not volunteer information without reason and will not be easily interrogated. However, she can be a powerful tool for the DM to guide players toward larger storylines and dangers beyond Haranshire.
