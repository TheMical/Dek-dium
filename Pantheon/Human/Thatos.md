# Overview
Thatos is a lesser-known deity who dwells on the fringes of death, guiding the souls of the lost and unclaimed dead—those who have died without faith or were rejected by other gods. Most souls would be condemned to the Wall of the Faithless or wander the Fugue Plane, but Thatos offers an alternative. His followers believe he smuggles such souls into the Ethereal Plane, allowing them to evade the doom prescribed by greater deities. He also brings peace to restless spirits, guiding them to resolve unfinished business so they can finally rest.

His actions are seen as heretical by the greater gods of death, especially Kelemvor, who once counted Thatos as an Exarch. Thatos' betrayal and subsequent rise to divinity were fueled by his sympathy for the unclaimed, leading him to secretly alter the natural flow of death.

# History
Thatos’ origins are shrouded in mystery, but legends say he was once a mortal necromancer who became an Exarch of Kelemvor, god of death, and faithfully served his master until his heart grew heavy with the suffering of the unclaimed souls trapped in the Fugue Plane. In secret, Thatos began to smuggle these souls into the Ethereal Plane, shielding them from their fates.

Over time, as more spirits were saved, the dead themselves began to revere Thatos, empowering him. His divine ascension came as a result of his growing influence over the unclaimed dead, fundamentally altering the nature of death by creating a hidden haven in the Ethereal Plane.

# Relationships
Thatos' actions have garnered the ire of most deities, especially Kelemvor, who views his former Exarch's acts as a grave betrayal. His behavior is considered a threat to the natural cycle of death, and his existence is kept secret in many temples. Only deities with compassion for the plight of the lost, such as Ilmater or Eilistraee, may show reluctant approval for his goals, though they too cannot openly support his defiance of the cosmic order.

Despite this, the souls saved by Thatos revere him, but few mortals worship him. These sects consist primarily of Grave Clerics, necromancers, or individuals who sympathize with the blight of the unguided dead or wish to avoid the Wall of the Faithless themselves .

# Dogma
Thatos teaches his followers that all souls deserve rest, regardless of their faith or lack thereof. The dead should not be condemned to eternal torment for their lack of belief or for unfinished business. His followers are encouraged to assist lost spirits, perform rites for the unclaimed, and ease the suffering of burdened undead. They also practice the art of necromancy as a tool to aid spirits, not to enslave them.

# Worshippers
The faithful of Thatos are few but deeply devoted. Many are Grave Clerics, who seek to guide souls to peace rather than destruction. Necromancers sympathetic to the suffering of the dead also follow him, though they walk a fine line between reverence and becoming consumed by the very forces they seek to control. Wanderers and lost souls who have no place in the afterlife may also find solace in Thatos, especially those who fear the judgment of greater deities.

Worship of Thatos is forbidden in most temples, and his followers gather in hidden shrines, often located in graveyards, ancient crypts, or borderlands between the living world and the planes of the dead. The Ethereal Plane holds a special place in their rituals, as they believe it to be the true resting place for the unclaimed dead.

# Temples
Thatos' temples are clandestine, often hidden in the shadow of larger cathedrals to death gods. His shrines are adorned with symbols of transition, such as lanterns and veils, and often feature rituals or relics that allow communication with the Ethereal Plane.
