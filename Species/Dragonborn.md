Dragonborn worship the original "Primordial" Dragons. Each type of Dragon has an originator, often given a name and a personality by Dragonborn.  
  
Dragonborn believe themselves to be the offspring of the Originators and the Humanoid races of the world. This means there is mostly Metallic dragonborn as the metallic primordial dragons cared more for humankind. However, chromatic dragonborn do exist are often believe to have been created as a form of conquering humans.  

Pure dragon Offspring of the originator dragons (essentially normal DnD dragons) are considered Demi-gods in Dragonborn culture, but many also resent them as they see them as a selfish rejection of Dragonborn by the Originators (typically this resentment is aimed at Chromatic Dragons).Â  Non-original Dragons are unable to produce off-spring with Humans.
